# AI PDP Copy Generator

A generic Chrome Extension that works across merchant websites (on Product Description Pages) to scrape title, description, shipping & returns, and replace them with LLM-generated content.

## Features
- Scrapes product title, description, shipping, and returns information from any merchant PDP.
- Replaces scraped content with copy generated by a Large Language Model (LLM).
- Works across several HTTP/HTTPS merchant sites.
- Configurable via options page.
- Supports mock mode for development/testing.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` if you add dependencies (none required for basic usage).
3. Create a file at `env/local.js` (see `env/template.js` for structure) to store your OpenAI API key and other environment variables. **Do not commit this file.**
4. Load the extension in Chrome:
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable Developer Mode
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select this project folder

## Usage
- Navigate to any product page on a merchant website.
- Click the extension icon and use the popup to generate and apply new copy.
- Configure your API key and options via the options page.

## Configuration (IMPORTANT for Manifest V3)

**Manifest V3 Chrome Extensions cannot load local files (like `env/local.js`) at runtime in the background service worker.**

- All configuration (API key, mock mode, model) must be set via the Options page, which stores values in `chrome.storage`.
- If you want to automate setting these values for local development, use the Options page or a script that writes to `chrome.storage`.

## Development Notes
- The extension uses Manifest V3 and ES modules.
- Main files:
   - `background.js`: Handles API calls, storage, and messaging. **Configuration is only read from `chrome.storage`.**
   - `contentScript.js`: Scrapes and replaces PDP content.
   - `popup.js`/`popup.html`: User interface for triggering actions.
   - `options.js`/`options.html`: Options page for configuration.

## Security
- Your API key is stored locally and never sent to third parties except OpenAI.
