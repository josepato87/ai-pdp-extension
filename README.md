- Supports mock mode for development/testing.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` if you add dependencies (none required for basic usage).
3. Create a file at `env/local.js` (see `env/template.js` for structure) to store your OpenAI API key and other environment variables. **Do not commit this file.**
4. Load the extension in Chrome:
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable Developer Mode
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select this project folder

## Usage
- Navigate to any product page on a merchant website.
- Click the extension icon and use the popup to generate and apply new copy.

## Development
- The extension uses Manifest V3 and ES modules.
- Main files:
   - `background.js`: Handles API calls, storage, and messaging.
   - `contentScript.js`: Scrapes and replaces PDP content.
   - `popup.js`/`popup.html`: User interface for triggering actions.
   - `options.js`/`options.html`: Options page for configuration.
